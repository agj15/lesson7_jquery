### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. jQuery: A commonly used JavaScript library. It helps coders create code with minimal added work. Most of the code needed is created for them, and is open for anyone to use. To use it you link .js file containing library to HTML document. Another way is to simply download it from jQuery.com and can specify a location on CDN. All of jQuery's code connects to JavaScript rules, and you know it is jQuery if you see a "$" at the beginning of the statement.
2. Event Handler: This can group jQuery statements into functions. For specifying an event handler: It is a backward-compatible event listener easier in jQuery. Starting with $, you specify selector for the elements associated with event. Then, you finish with method that specifies different events and actions.
3. API: This stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of clearly defined methods of communication between various software components. It will specify how a software component will act. Most programs we use are API's and we do not even realize. Some examples of API's are JavaScript, HTTP, Python, XML, HTML and of course, jQuery.
